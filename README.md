# Visendus

Visendus is a stealth game made by [inhumanrobot](https://twitter.com/inhumanrobot) and I for My First Game Jam Summer 2019, using the Godot game engine.

You play as a prototype robot with the ability to scan entities and project a hologram to disguise yourself as those entities. You have been awoken to help a new friend.
